Thank you so much for looking at this.
Really love your triggering intensifies pic! üòä You have really made my day!

Happy to sit down with Gill, Carl and yourself and do the chocolatey server properly ‚Äì would help to get things in place as we‚Äôll need to use it soon to push Richard‚Äôs receipt reprint app.
Lets just setup a meeting.

Thanks!

The script that‚Äôs being run when you do a ‚Äòchoco install anpr-api anpr-ui‚Äô is not the same script David is changing. It‚Äôs a script that‚Äôs embedded in the actual package and just stops the service, backs up the install and then does the upgrade.

In all honesty I‚Äôm still perplexed as to why the choco remote script even exists, there‚Äôs a lot of code to do not a lot of things.

SO-MSP-APP03 is not permitted to access the chocolatey server. The Choco remote script doesn‚Äôt really need to check if the server is up because it‚Äôs entirely irrelevant for what it‚Äôs doing. Why does the remote install script care if it can‚Äôt see the server? Surely the only important thing is that the client can reach the server, and that will be checked and reported by the Chocolatey client itself if it‚Äôs down.

There are a lot of issues with this script and I‚Äôd like to suggest we try to move away from it if we can and seek alternatives:

‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs not particularly well written
o	There‚Äôs variables written to the global scope for no reason instead of just passing them to functions that need them
o	It uses $args instead of a parameter block that will self-validate arguments like upgrade, install etc
o	Function names don‚Äôt follow proper naming conventions
‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs slow because it loops through the list of sites one-by-one instead of just letting PowerShell do it asynchronously
o	You can feed as many hostnames/ips to -ComputerName in Invoke-Command as you want and PowerShell will batch them all up and do some of them at the same time
‚Ä¢	It asks for your credentials for no reason and doesn‚Äôt verify them so if you typo your password you‚Äôre ripe to lock your account out when it tries to logon to hundreds of machines
o	You don‚Äôt need to provide a credential object to Invoke-Command, it will just use the current users logon token if you don‚Äôt

You could more or less do the same thing the script is doing quicker and more efficiently by just running:

Invoke-Command -ComputerName ASDA9998ANPR.asd.msp.htec.co.uk, ASDA9999ANPR.asd.msp.htec.co.uk -ScriptBlock {
    choco upgrade anpr-api -y
    $apiExitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
    
    choco upgrade anpr-ui -y
    $uiExitCode = $LASTEXITCODE

    [PSCustomObject]@{
        APIExitCode = $apiExitCode;
        UIExitCode = $uiExitCode;
    }
} | Select-Object PSComputerName, APIExitCode, UIExitCode | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation | Tee-Object C:\Scripts\ASDA\Choco\Logs\installs.csv | ConvertFrom-Csv

And any that return anything other than 0 in the exit codes didn‚Äôt work and we can use Zabbix to monitor the Chocolatey client log.

Honestly I‚Äôm really annoyed with how we‚Äôve handled this whole Chocolatey thing, it‚Äôs been totally mismanaged and has meant we‚Äôre doing everything ass-backwards but hey, hopefully if we can get together with Carl and Gill we can nip this in the bud‚Ä¶ Rant over.

Morning Sam,

How you doing? Please have a little read and lemme know what you think is going wrong?

From our chat yesterday‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve tried choco install anpr-api anpr-ui from ASDA9998ANPR  it then asks to run the choco script which David setup (this is the one I need to test)
If I say Yes (see below) the install works perfectly once you type ‚Äúy‚Äù

 

PO-MSP-APP03 or SO-MSP-APP03

If I try to do the install from PO-MSP-APP03 or SO-MSP-APP03 using the choco remote install script (attached) ‚Äì this is how we install to large number of sites on the Estate, I cannot connect to 9998.
 

Can you please advise? It normally works from SO-MSP-APP03 ‚Äì that‚Äôs where we push the packages to the Estate. 
I‚Äôve launched cmd prompt as administrator and tried, but its not that.

 

Changes to the new choco remote install script:

A few improvements to the ChocoRemote script
Report and error if the Choco server is down or unreachable
Do a fresh log each day, appending the date to the filename
Add a summary log of outcomes per site
Add option to upgrade either API or UI or both
Install option can also set the server source to save rebooting twice

Please advise?
